## The shoulders on which Llama Logic stands
This began as a project to create a desktop app to augment the player experience in Maxis' The Sims 4.
In order to do that, it was going to need to able to read from (and eventually write to) package files for the game.
There was [a project](https://github.com/s4ptacle/Sims4Tools), referred to by the community as "s4pi", which was able to do this.
But it had been long abandoned and was in desperate need of an escort through a decade of upgrades to the .NET Common Language Runtime, Base Class Library, and C# language.
We saw to that, but couldn't have done so without all the work done by legends of the past.

As Llama Logic owes its existence to them just as much as it does us, the NuGet libraries maintained and published from here are also brought to you, in spirit, by:
