# You've Found a Manifested Mod

## What is a Manifested Mod?
It's a mod that contains a manifest!
But... *what is a manifest?*
A manifest tells apps and other mods about the manifested mod, including:
* Its name
* Who made it
* What version it is
* Where it can be downloaded
* What packs or other mods it requires
* The guidelines for properly installing it

## Okay, but what is it doing for me as a player?
If you're not using any Manifest-Aware apps or mods, nothing.
But, oh my goodness... *if you are...*
* Companion apps for players of The Sims 4 can use manifests to double-check how you've installed a mod and help you correct mistakes
* Advanced scripting mods for The Sims 4 are able to read the manifests, too, potentially providing you with helpful information like... where exactly did you download that fun couch CC again?

## What player apps could I get that are Manifest-Aware?
Right now, the list of which we are aware is:
* [PlumbBuddy](https://plumbbuddy.app) - A friendly helper for Sims 4 mods

We'll add more as we become aware of them, so check back later if you're interested.

## Actually, I'm a mod creator myself. How do I manifest my mods?
Right now, here's the list of manifest-aware tools of which we know that can help you add and maintaining manifests in your mods:
* [PlumbBuddy](https://plumbbuddy.app) - A friendly helper for Sims 4 mods

Once again, we'll add more as we become aware of them, so check back later if you're interested.

Also, feel free to plop this fun sticker on your mods' download pages as you manifest them.
You can link players who use your custom content to this page so they can learn about all the benefits the manifest in your mod can bring them.
