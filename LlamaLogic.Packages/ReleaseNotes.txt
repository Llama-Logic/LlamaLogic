We added manifest deletion and set methods to ModFileManifestModel to make it easier for tooling creators using this library to consistently manifest mod files. Script mod files are now expected to contain a manifest in any location in the directory structure, and this library will automatically place them inside sole directories within script mod files so as not to cause archive utilities to alter their behavior when unzipping script mod files simply because they have been manifested.
