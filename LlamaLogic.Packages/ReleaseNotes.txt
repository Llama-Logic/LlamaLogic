We added the ResourceKeyOrder enumeration, which is accepted by the DataBasePackedFile methods: CopyTo, CopyToAsync, GetKeys, GetKeysAsync, Save, SaveAs, SaveAsync, and SaveAsAsync. It allows callers to control the order in which the library will iterate over resource keys when performing an operation. We also corrected a defect in DataBasePackedFile in which Delete was not thread-safe, and added calls to FileStream.Dispose in areas to ensure the library will have released file handles when the caller likely expects that it should have.
