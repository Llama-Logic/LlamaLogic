We added "Raw" methods to access the content of resources in packages without having the library first automatically decompress them for you (if you need that for some reason). We added a TGI ordering option to ResourceKeyOrder. We added "ForEach" methods to operate in batch on several resources in a package while entering its resource management mutex only once. We made several revisions to the mod manifest format in preparation for it to be used. We fixed a few defects and glitches in DataBasePackedFile.
