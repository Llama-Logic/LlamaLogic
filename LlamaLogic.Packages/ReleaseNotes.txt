The DataBasePackedFile class now supports full compression and decompression of Maxis Internal compression via the AuroraLib.Compression library. CompressionMode.ForceZLib and CompressionMode.ForceInternal have been added to force ZLIB and Maxis Internal compression, respectively, when calling Set methods. CompressionMode.ForceOn and CompressionMode.CallerSuppliedInternal have been deprecated and will cause Set methods to throw. The GetExplicitCompressionMode method has been added to the DataBasePackedFile class to determine what CompressionMode value to pass to Set methods to ensure they compress a resource's content in the same manner it is currently compressed. Recognition of the Phone Photo Thumbnail, Save Game Data, Save Thumbnail 1, Save Thumbnail 2, Save Thumbnail 4, Save Thumbnail 5, and Zone Object Data resources found in Sims 4 save game packages has been added.
