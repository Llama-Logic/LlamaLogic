We added a JointPhotographicExpertsGroupImage ResourceFileType and changed the ResourceType SaveGameCustomTexture from ResourceFileType Ts4TranslucentJointPhotographicExpertsGroupImage to JointPhotographicExpertsGroupImage. We moved DataBasePackedFile's static methods for Maxis translucent JPEGs to a new static class: Formats.Ts4TranslucentJointPhotographicExpertsGroupImage. We corrected a defect in DataBasePackedFile ForEach and ForEachAsync in which a deleted index entry could prematurely terminate the loop, throwing an exception (implicitly found by TURBODRIVER).
